The LGA 3647 motherboards go down in price and I managed to buy an [Intel S2066ST dual socket motherboard from eBay for ~â‚¬250](https://ebay.us/2SZIaW). The motherboard works great and I don't have any complaints but the "fun" thing is the TPM 2.0 connector.

## Intel LGA 3647 S2600ST TPM 2.0

According to the [Intel's manual](/assets/2024-07-27-intel-s2600-tpm20/Intel_S2600ST_TPS.pdf), the motherboardd should be compatible with 12-pin TPM 2.0 modules.

>A TPM device is optionally installed onto a high density **12-pin connector** labeled "TPM" on the server board, and is secured from external software attacks and physical theft.

The supported parts are supposed to be:

- [Trusted platform module 2.0 (Rest of World) - iPC - **AXXTPMENC8**](https://ebay.us/yepVgf).
- Trusted platform module 2.0 (China Version) - iPC - **AXXTPME8**.

The only problem is that the **AXXTPMENC8** is a 14-pin part and that is also confirmed by another manual: [Intel Server S2600ST Product Family](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/server-products/server-boards/S2600ST_P4000ConfigGuide.pdf).

While the motherboard connector is indeed a 12-pin one.

I went through dozens of Google search pages and could not find a single picture of a 12-pin Intel TPM module. The documentation has this cryptic history entry:

>Corrected # of pins on TPM

Please let me know if you have any documentation or info about this mysterious 12-pin TPM 2.0 module.

Thanks to my Discord member `whiskytango9` who found this eBay listing, I have a picture of a 12-pin TPM module. It's not yet known what is shown in the picture since it is a stock photo, so I will try to clarify things with the seller.

[Intel Trusted Platform Module 2.0", AXXTPMENC8](https://www.ebay.com/itm/266562844499?mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5338941691&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1).

I asked about this 12-pin TPM module at the official Intel support forum:

[12-pin AXXTPMENC8 TPM for S2600ST LGA 3647 motherboard](https://community.intel.com/t5/Server-Products/12-pin-AXXTPMENC8-TPM-for-S2600ST-LGA-3647-motherboard/m-p/1618978#M24887).

Unfortunately, Intel's customer support is utterly incompetent, so far I have not gotten a single relevant answer and it feels like the support agents do not even read the original post.

Another picture of the 12-pin AXXTPMENC8 TPM, this time from Intel themselves.
