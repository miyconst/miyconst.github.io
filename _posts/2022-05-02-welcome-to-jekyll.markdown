My previous blog's engine was developed by me about ten years ago, and I should have moved to GitHub pages long time ago, but as it always happen, I had more important things to do.

Up until now I used a russian hosting company for my blog (there were reasons), but the paid period has ended and since I am no longer paying any money to russia, I have to move my blog. They would not let me easily move my `miyconst.com` domain to another registrator, thus I have decided to get rid of the domain and just use `miyconst.github.io` instead.

I will slowly move my old articles to the new place, but it will take some time until everything is moved.
