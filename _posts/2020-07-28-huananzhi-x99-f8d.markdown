After publishing my detailed review of the motherboard, I have figured out a few more important facts:

- Even though the BIOS on Huananzhi X99-F8D is blocked for [FPT](https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Intel-Management-Engine-Drivers-Firmware-amp-System-Tools.html), it's possible to flash the BIOS with `AfuDos`. Compatible `AfuDos` version as well as the original BIOS can be [downloaded from the official Huananzhi website](http://www.huananzhi.com:8080/driversdownload/X99-T8DDrive/x99-F8DBIOS20-6-14.rar).
- There is an alternative USB 3.0 driver, which resolves issues with the ports.

The USB 3.0 driver and X99-F8D BIOS with compatible `AfuDos` can be downloaded from my [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtZZXDjjb94kgYcRRVvGy43xGiMERQ?e=qswuBF).
