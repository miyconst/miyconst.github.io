The LGA 3647 motherboards go down in price and I managed to buy an [Intel S2066ST dual socket motherboard from eBay for ~€250](https://ebay.us/2SZIaW). The motherboard works great and I don't have any complaints but the "fun" thing is the TPM 2.0 connector.

## Intel LGA 3647 S2600ST TPM 2.0

According to the [Intel's manual](/2024-07-27-intel-s2600-tpm2.0/Intel_S2600ST_TPS.pdf), the motherboardd should be compatible with 12-pin TPM 2.0 modules.

>A TPM device is optionally installed onto a high density 12-pin connector labeled "TPM" on the server board, and is secured from external software attacks and physical theft.

The supported parts are supposed to be:

- [Trusted platform module 2.0 (Rest of World) - iPC - **AXXTPMENC8**](https://ebay.us/yepVgf).
- Trusted platform module 2.0 (China Version) - iPC - **AXXTPME8**.

The only problem is that the **AXXTPMENC8** is a 14-pin part and that is also confirmed by another Intel's manual: [Intel Server S2600ST Product Family](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/server-products/server-boards/S2600ST_P4000ConfigGuide.pdf).

While the motherboard connector is indeed a 12-pin one.

I went through dozens of Google search pages and could not find a single picture of a 12-pin Intel TPM module. The documentation has this cryptic history entry:

>Corrected # of pins on TPM

Please let me know if you have any documentation or info about this misterious 12-pin TPM 2.0 module.
